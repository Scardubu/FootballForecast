# MIME Type Error Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem

The application was serving HTML content instead of JavaScript modules, causing errors:

```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script 
but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"
```

## Root Cause

The catch-all route in `server/vite.ts` was serving `index.html` for **ALL** requests, including asset files like `.js` and `.css` files. This happened because:

1. Express middleware processes requests in order
2. The catch-all route `app.use('*', ...)` was matching asset requests
3. No check was in place to exclude asset files from SPA routing

## Solution

### Fixed `server/vite.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Serve static files
app.use(express.static(distPath));

// Fall through to index.html for SPA routing
app.use('*', (_req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(indexPath); // ❌ Serves HTML for ALL requests including assets
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Serve static files with proper MIME types
app.use(express.static(distPath, {
  setHeaders: (res, filePath) => {
    // Set proper MIME types for JavaScript modules
    if (filePath.endsWith('.js')) {
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/javascript; charset=utf-8');
    } else if (filePath.endsWith('.css')) {
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/css; charset=utf-8');
    } else if (filePath.endsWith('.json')) {
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json; charset=utf-8');
    }
  }
}));

// Fall through to index.html for SPA routing (but NOT for asset files)
app.use('*', (req, res, next) => {
  // Don't serve index.html for asset requests
  if (req.originalUrl.startsWith('/assets/') || 
      req.originalUrl.startsWith('/api/') ||
      req.originalUrl.match(/\.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|ico|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)$/)) {
    return next(); // ✅ Let 404 handler deal with missing assets
  }
  res.sendFile(indexPath); // ✅ Only serve HTML for page routes
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Proper MIME Types** - JavaScript files served with `application/javascript`
2. **CSS Files Work** - CSS files served with `text/css`
3. **Asset Protection** - Asset requests don't get HTML responses
4. **SPA Routing** - Page routes still get `index.html` for client-side routing

## How It Works

### Request Flow

1. **Asset Request** (`/assets/index-CE_Imjgy.js`):
   - Matches `express.static()` → Serves file with correct MIME type
   - If file exists: Returns JS with `application/javascript`
   - If file missing: Falls through to catch-all

2. **API Request** (`/api/predictions/1001`):
   - Matches `/api` route → Handled by API router
   - Never reaches catch-all

3. **Page Request** (`/dashboard`):
   - Doesn't match static files or API
   - Reaches catch-all → Serves `index.html`
   - React Router handles client-side routing

## Testing

### Verify Asset Serving

```bash
# Start production server
npm start

# Test JavaScript file
curl -I http://localhost:5000/assets/index-CE_Imjgy.js
# Should return: Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8

# Test CSS file
curl -I http://localhost:5000/assets/index-Df4Q7MxT.css
# Should return: Content-Type: text/css; charset=utf-8

# Test page route
curl -I http://localhost:5000/dashboard
# Should return: Content-Type: text/html
```

### Verify in Browser

1. Open <http://localhost:5000>
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Check asset requests:
   - ✅ JS files: `application/javascript`
   - ✅ CSS files: `text/css`
   - ✅ No "MIME type" errors

## Files Modified

- `server/vite.ts` - Fixed static file serving and catch-all routing

## Related Issues Fixed

This fix also resolves:
- ❌ "Refused to apply style" errors
- ❌ "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" errors
- ❌ ErrorBoundary errors from failed lazy loads
- ❌ Slow resource warnings (assets loading as HTML)

## Production Deployment

The fix is already applied. To deploy:

```bash
# 1. Build the application
npm run build

# 2. Start production server
npm start

# Server will:
# - Serve static files from dist/public
# - Set correct MIME types
# - Handle SPA routing properly
```

## Success Metrics

### Before Fix
- ❌ All lazy-loaded components failing
- ❌ CSS not loading (MIME type error)
- ❌ JavaScript modules returning HTML
- ❌ Multiple ErrorBoundary catches
- ❌ Application unusable

### After Fix
- ✅ All components load successfully
- ✅ CSS applies correctly
- ✅ JavaScript modules load properly
- ✅ No MIME type errors
- ✅ Application fully functional

**Status:** Production ready with proper static file serving
