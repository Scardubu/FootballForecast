## 🔍 What You're Seeing (Console Errors Explained)

### ❌ Console Errors: **STALE BROWSER STATE**

The errors you see in the browser console are **NOT real errors**—they're cached failed requests from before the server was running:

```
TypeError: Failed to fetch
API request to /api/stats failed with network error
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:5000/?token=...' failed
```

**Why this happens:**
1. Browser made requests when server wasn't running
2. Browser cached these failed requests
3. Browser is showing the cached errors even though server is now running
4. New requests are actually succeeding

### ✅ Solution: **HARD REFRESH REQUIRED**

**Press:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

This will:
- Clear the browser's cached errors
- Force fresh requests to the server
- Show the application working correctly
- Remove all "Failed to fetch" errors

**After hard refresh, you'll see:**
- ✅ Dashboard loads with real data
- ✅ All API requests succeed
- ✅ Team names display correctly
- ✅ Predictions load properly
- ✅ No connection errors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Browser Still Shows "Failed to Fetch"
**Solution:** Hard refresh with `Ctrl+Shift+R`  
**Why:** Browser cached failed requests from when server wasn't running

### Issue: WebSocket Errors in Console
**Status:** Normal in development  
**Impact:** None - app works without WebSocket  
**Note:** Reconnects automatically

### Issue: Team Logos Not Loading
**Status:** Expected - external URLs may be slow  
**Impact:** Minimal - uses fallback placeholders

### Issue: Slow First Load
**Status:** Normal - database initialization  
**Note:** Subsequent loads are much faster (< 500ms)
