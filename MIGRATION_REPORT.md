# Football Forecast Migration Report

## Summary

This document details the systematic migration from a Replit/Nix/Neon-based stack to a fully cross-platform, production-ready environment suitable for local and cloud deployment. All Replit-specific, Nix, and Neon dependencies have been removed. The codebase is now optimized for local development, Docker-based workflows, and production deployment on any standard infrastructure.

---

## Key Migration Actions

### 1. TypeScript Error Resolution

- Fixed critical TypeScript errors preventing successful builds:
  - Resolved syntax error in `server/db-storage.ts`
  - Fixed type issues in `client/src/components/data-visualization.tsx` for handling null values
  - Corrected button size type in `client/src/components/accessibility.tsx`
  - Added proper type definitions in `client/src/components/team-performance.tsx`
  - Fixed error handling in `server/routers/health.ts` and `server/services/apiFootballClient.ts`
- Updated API interface definitions to properly handle error responses
- Added type guards for unknown error types
- Ensured nullish coalescing operators for potentially null values

### 2. Dependency & Config Cleanup

- Removed all Replit/Nix/Neon-specific dependencies and configuration files.
- Standardized all environment variables and documented them in `.env.example`.
- Ensured all scripts and Dockerfiles use platform-agnostic tools (`pg` for Postgres, `cross-env`, etc).
- Replaced `pyproject.toml` with a minimal, cross-platform version for the Python ML service.

### 3. Backend (Node.js)

- Uses `pg` and Drizzle ORM for local and production Postgres.
- Compatible with Docker Compose for local orchestration.
- All scripts and VS Code tasks updated for dev/prod parity.

### 4. Python ML Service

- Cleaned `pyproject.toml` for cross-platform compatibility.
- Dockerfile supports both `uv` and `pip` workflows.

### 5. Frontend

- Vite and Tailwind fully optimized for production builds.
- No Replit-specific plugins or configs remain.

### 6. Documentation & Onboarding

- All quick start, troubleshooting, and deployment instructions verified for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Next Steps

- Run `docker-compose up --build` for local development.
- For production, use the provided Dockerfiles and `.env.production` for secure configuration.
- For manual local dev, use `npm run dev:node` and `npm run dev:python` in separate terminals.

---

## Validation

- All dev and prod scripts, Dockerfiles, and configs tested for cross-platform compatibility.
- Manual and automated validation recommended before go-live.
