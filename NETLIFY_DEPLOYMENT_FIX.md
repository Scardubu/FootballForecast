# Netlify Deployment Fix - October 8, 2025

## Issue Summary

The deployment was failing due to the `netlify-plugin-image-optim` plugin encountering an internal error during the post-build phase:

```
Plugin "netlify-plugin-image-optim" internal error
TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'post')
```

**Root Cause:**
- The plugin is outdated and incompatible with current Netlify build system
- It was installed via Netlify UI (not netlify.toml)
- The plugin attempts to optimize images but fails when no images are found in expected paths

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated netlify.toml Configuration

Added explicit plugin configuration to control which plugins run:

```toml
# Plugin configuration - disable problematic image optimizer
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-cloudinary"
  
[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-lighthouse"

# Disable image-optim plugin that's causing build failures
# To fully remove, go to: Site Settings > Plugins in Netlify UI
```

### 2. Created Images Directory Structure

Created `dist/public/images/.gitkeep` to satisfy Cloudinary plugin expectations and prevent path errors.

### 3. Plugin Management Strategy

**Keep These Plugins (Working):**
- ✅ `netlify-plugin-cloudinary` - Image optimization via CDN
- ✅ `@netlify/plugin-lighthouse` - Performance monitoring

**Remove from Netlify UI:**
- ❌ `netlify-plugin-image-optim` - Outdated and causing errors
- ❌ `netlify-plugin-html-validate` - Optional, can be removed if causing issues

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option A: Deploy Without Removing Plugin (Quick Fix)

The netlify.toml changes will prevent the plugin from running even if installed:

```bash
# Rebuild and deploy
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist/public
```

### Option B: Remove Plugin from Netlify UI (Recommended)

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: <https://app.netlify.com>
   - Select your site: `SabiScore` / `resilient-souffle-0daafe`

2. **Remove Problematic Plugins**
   - Go to: **Site Settings** → **Build & deploy** → **Build plugins**
   - Find `netlify-plugin-image-optim`
   - Click **Remove** or **Disable**
   - Optionally remove `netlify-plugin-html-validate` if not needed

3. **Trigger New Deployment**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist/public
   ```

### Option C: Deploy via Git Push (Automatic)

If your site is connected to Git, simply push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Update netlify.toml to disable problematic plugins"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically deploy with the new configuration.

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] No plugin errors in build log
- [ ] Functions deploy correctly (api.ts, ml-health.ts)
- [ ] Site loads at: <https://resilient-souffle-0daafe.netlify.app>
- [ ] All routes work (/, /betting-insights, /telemetry)
- [ ] API endpoints respond: `/api/leagues`, `/api/predictions`
- [ ] Static assets load from `/assets/*`
- [ ] Security headers are applied

## 🔧 Build Output Expected

```
✓ Client build successful (1m 54s)
✓ Functions bundled (api.ts, ml-health.ts)
✓ Cloudinary plugin completed
✓ Lighthouse plugin completed (if enabled)
✗ Image-optim plugin: SKIPPED (disabled in config)
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

**Expected Build Output:**
- **Build Time:** ~2 minutes
- **Bundle Sizes:**
  - Main: 59.35 kB (gzipped: 18.15 kB)
  - Vendor React: 689.19 kB (gzipped: 203.22 kB)
  - CSS: 68.38 kB (gzipped: 12.19 kB)

**Production Metrics:**
- Lighthouse Score: 95+
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.5s
- Total Bundle Size: < 1MB

## 🛠️ Alternative Image Optimization

If you need image optimization, consider these alternatives:

### 1. Cloudinary (Already Enabled)

Already configured via `netlify-plugin-cloudinary`. Images are automatically optimized when served through Cloudinary CDN.

**Usage:**
```html
<!-- Images will be auto-optimized -->
<img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
```

### 2. Manual Optimization (Pre-build)

Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "optimize:images": "imagemin 'src/assets/**/*.{jpg,png}' --out-dir='dist/public/assets'",
    "prebuild": "npm run optimize:images"
  }
}
```

### 3. Vite Built-in Optimization

Vite already optimizes images imported in code:
```typescript
import logo from './assets/logo.png';
// Vite will optimize and hash the filename
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build Still Fails

1. **Clear Netlify Cache:**
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist/public --clear-cache
   ```

2. **Check Environment Variables:**
   - Verify `NODE_VERSION` and `NPM_VERSION` in Site Settings
   - Ensure no secrets are in netlify.toml

3. **Review Build Log:**
   - Check for other plugin errors
   - Verify all dependencies install correctly

### Plugin Still Runs

If the plugin still appears in logs:

1. Remove it via Netlify UI (see Option B above)
2. Clear deploy cache
3. Trigger new build

### Functions Don't Deploy

Check:
```bash
# Verify functions exist
ls netlify/functions/

# Should see:
# - api.ts
# - ml-health.ts
```

## 📝 Configuration Reference

### Current netlify.toml Structure

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm run build"

[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-cloudinary"  # ✅ Keep
  
[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-lighthouse"  # ✅ Keep

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "esbuild"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat"
  status = 200
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Now:**
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist/public
   ```

2. **Monitor Deployment:**
   - Watch build log for errors
   - Verify site loads correctly
   - Test all functionality

3. **Optional Cleanup:**
   - Remove unused plugins from Netlify UI
   - Update package.json if needed
   - Document custom configurations
