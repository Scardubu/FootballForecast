# Integration Roadmap - ML-Powered Betting Platform

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
### Milestone: Robust Data Pipeline

#### Day 1-2: Scraping Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up Playwright with stealth mode
- [ ] Implement proxy rotation system
- [ ] Create FBref scraper for xG data
- [ ] Add WhoScored ratings scraper

#### Day 3-4: Data Storage
- [ ] Design SQLite schema for scraped data
- [ ] Implement caching layers (memory + file)
- [ ] Create data validation pipeline
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms

#### Day 5-7: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Connect scrapers to existing API endpoints
- [ ] Test resilience with proxy failures
- [ ] Validate data quality and completeness
- [ ] Performance optimization

**Verification**: `python test_scrapers.py && sqlite3 data.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM scraped_matches"`

## Phase 2: ML Development (Week 2)
### Milestone: Predictive Models

#### Day 8-10: Feature Engineering
- [ ] Extract xG trends and momentum features
- [ ] Create form-based features (W-D-L streaks)
- [ ] Injury impact scoring system
- [ ] Head-to-head historical features

#### Day 11-12: Model Training
- [ ] Time-series cross-validation setup
- [ ] XGBoost model with hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Probability calibration (Platt scaling)
- [ ] Model evaluation (Brier score, log loss)

#### Day 13-14: Model Serving
- [ ] FastAPI inference endpoints
- [ ] Model versioning and A/B testing
- [ ] SHAP explanations integration
- [ ] Performance monitoring

**Verification**: `python train_models.py && python test_predictions.py`

## Phase 3: Enhanced UI (Week 3)
### Milestone: Production-Ready Interface

#### Day 15-17: Advanced Analytics
- [ ] Explainable AI dashboard
- [ ] Interactive Plotly visualizations
- [ ] Fixture selection with smart filtering
- [ ] Real-time confidence intervals

#### Day 18-19: Performance & UX
- [ ] Sub-400ms cached responses
- [ ] Progressive loading and skeleton states
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Error handling and graceful degradation

#### Day 20-21: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] End-to-end testing suite (≥80% coverage)
- [ ] Load testing and optimization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Production deployment

**Verification**: `streamlit run app.py && pytest --cov=src tests/`

```

## Success Metrics
- **Data Coverage**: ≥90% of fixtures have xG data
- **Model Accuracy**: ≥5% lift over baseline (coin flip)
- **Response Time**: P95 ≤400ms cached, ≤3s fresh scrapes
- **Uptime**: ≥99% availability with fallback data
- **Test Coverage**: ≥80% code coverage
