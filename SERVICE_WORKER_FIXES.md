# Service Worker & API Fixes

## Issues Resolved

1.  **Service Worker Caching Errors:**
    *   **Problem:** The service worker was attempting to cache resources from browser extensions (`chrome-extension://`), causing errors.
    *   **Fix:** Updated `client/public/sw.js` to only handle `http` and `https` requests, ignoring all other protocols.

2.  **API 404 Errors:**
    *   **Problem:** The Netlify function for the API was not routing requests correctly, resulting in 404 errors for valid endpoints.
    *   **Fix:** Modified `netlify/functions/api.ts` to mount the API router at `/api`, aligning it with the Netlify redirect configuration.

## Current Status

*   The service worker errors are resolved.
*   The API routing is corrected, but the API is still in a "degraded" state due to missing environment variables.
*   The database connection is unhealthy.

## Next Steps

*   Ensure environment variables are correctly loaded in the Netlify serverless environment.
*   Verify the database connection.
