## ðŸ§  1. Codebase Audit & Refactor

* [ ] Run a **full-stack diagnostic scan** (frontend, backend, scrapers, ML, infra).
* [ ] Identify **integration gaps, hidden errors, performance bottlenecks**.
* [ ] Apply **modular, single-responsibility architecture** (logic, rendering, data layers).
* [ ] Standardize **formatting, naming conventions, testing boundaries**.
* [ ] Replace **legacy workflows** with **reactive, scalable patterns** for high-load reliability.

---

## ðŸ“¡ 2. Scraping & Data Expansion

* [ ] Build resilient scrapers with **Playwright/Puppeteer**, **BullMQ scheduling**, and **rotating proxies**.
* [ ] Integrate feeds from **FlashScore, Understat, WhoScored, Bet365, etc.**
* [ ] Collect **historical datasets** (form, xG, injuries, odds history).
* [ ] Normalize, clean, and **optimize pipelines** for ML + analytics.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ 3. ML & Real-Time API Integration

* [ ] Deploy **FastAPI ML microservices** in `/ml`.
* [ ] Ingest **real-time + historical data** into probabilistic models.
* [ ] Generate **dynamic value-bet estimations**.
* [ ] Deliver predictions for **user-selected upcoming matches**.
* [ ] Implement **WebSockets** (`match:update`, `alert:valueBet`) with **failover handling**.

---

## ðŸŽ¨ 4. UX, Features & Visual Design

* [ ] Refine **React + Tailwind UI** for sleek, responsive design.
* [ ] Add **interactive visualizations** (odds shifts, animated trends, match insights).
* [ ] Blend **analytics + entertainment** into a **bettor-friendly flow**.
* [ ] Ensure **material-inspired + glassmorphic design consistency**.
