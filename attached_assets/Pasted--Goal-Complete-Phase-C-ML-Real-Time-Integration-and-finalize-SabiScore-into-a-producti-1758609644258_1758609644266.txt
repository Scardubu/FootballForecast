**Goal:** Complete **Phase C ‚Äì ML & Real-Time Integration** and finalize SabiScore into a **production-grade platform** that delivers an **informative, entertaining, aesthetically cohesive, and engaging betting intelligence experience**.

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Codebase Audit & Quick Wins

* [ ] Analyze the repo for integration gaps, errors, and UI inconsistencies.
* [ ] Apply quick fixes: broken imports, mismatched configs, outdated dependencies.
* [ ] Document findings as inline TODOs for clarity.

### 2. Team Names & Flags (Consistency + Visual Cohesion)

* [ ] Normalize team names with a canonical `team_id` mapping.
* [ ] Fix flags: use optimized SVG sprites for crisp rendering.
* [ ] Add graceful fallbacks: neutral placeholder + tooltip with full team name.
* [ ] Ensure **visual consistency**: align names/flags across match cards, tables, and live updates.

### 3. ML Microservice (Informative Predictions)

* [ ] Package the prediction model as a **FastAPI service** in `/ml`.
* [ ] Implement:

  * `POST /predict` (input validation + probabilities + metadata).
  * `GET /health` and `GET /metrics` for observability.
* [ ] Include **model versioning** and prediction confidence levels.
* [ ] Surface **explanations/insights** in responses (e.g., key factors influencing prediction).

### 4. Real-Time Integration (Engagement)

* [ ] Stream live data and predictions through a message layer (BullMQ/Redis).
* [ ] Implement WebSocket events:

  * `match:update`
  * `prediction:update`
  * `alert:valueBet`
* [ ] Add **animated, real-time updates** to the frontend to boost engagement.
* [ ] Test end-to-end: fake match ‚Üí prediction ‚Üí alert ‚Üí frontend visualization.

### 5. Alerts & Notifications (Interactive Experience)

* [ ] Integrate **Telegram bot** for match updates & value-bet alerts (configurable via `.env`).
* [ ] Add **Slack webhook integration** for team alerts & trend notifications.
* [ ] Format alerts to be **informative and entertaining**:

  * Include team flags + names.
  * Display odds shifts, confidence %, and fun microcopy (e.g., ‚Äú‚ö° Big value spotted!‚Äù).
* [ ] Allow toggling alerts in config (`ALERTS_ENABLED`, `ALERT_CHANNELS`).

### 6. UI/UX Review & Polish (Aesthetically Cohesive)

* [ ] Ensure **consistent spacing, typography, and colors** across all pages.
* [ ] Add **skeleton loaders** for live lists (reduce jumpiness).
* [ ] Enhance match cards with **interactive tooltips** (injuries, odds history, prediction confidence).
* [ ] Refine odds visualizations with **animated trends & smooth transitions**.
* [ ] Ensure **responsive design**: desktop ‚Üí tablet ‚Üí mobile.
* [ ] Apply **material-inspired + subtle glassmorphic design** for modern appeal.

### 7. Monitoring & Reliability (Trustworthy Experience)

* [ ] Log every prediction with `match_id`, `team_id`, and `model_version`.
* [ ] Alert via Slack/Telegram if pipelines fail or predictions stall.
* [ ] Add lightweight **data drift detection** and log warnings if inputs deviate.

### 8. Deployment & Docs

* [ ] Add Dockerfile for `/ml` service.
* [ ] Update CI/CD: linting, schema checks, integration tests.
* [ ] Provide a **short runbook**: how to deploy, retrain, and troubleshoot.

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

* Predictions are **informative** (probabilities + confidence + explanation).
* UX is **entertaining and engaging** (animated updates, live alerts, fun microcopy).
* Design is **aesthetically cohesive** (material + subtle glassmorphic).
* Alerts via **Telegram/Slack** are timely, clear, and visually enhanced.
* Team names & flags display correctly across all components.
* The platform feels **professional, polished, and production-ready**.

‚ö°Ô∏è **Experience-driven Quick Wins Included:**

* Fun + informative alert messages with emojis.
* Smooth animations for odds and predictions.
* Tooltip insights for deeper bettor engagement.
* Fallback visuals for robustness (never broken UI).
* Polished design system with consistency across devices.
