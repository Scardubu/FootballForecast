- **Steps**:
  1. Checkout repository
  2. Setup Node.js environment
  3. Install dependencies
  4. Run type check
  5. Build application
  6. Deploy to Netlify
  7. Run database migrations

## Verification Results

The deployment has been verified using the checklist in `DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md`:

- **Frontend**: Successfully deployed and accessible
- **Backend API**: All endpoints functioning correctly
- **Database**: Successfully connected and migrations applied
- **Security**: HTTPS enabled, authentication working, and rate limiting in place

## Next Steps
