## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables

All required environment variables have been configured:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string for Supabase
- `API_FOOTBALL_KEY`: API key for football data service
- `API_BEARER_TOKEN`: Secure token for API authentication
- `SCRAPER_AUTH_TOKEN`: Secure token for scraper authentication
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production" for production environment

### Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created:

- `ENV_SETUP.md`: Instructions for setting up environment variables
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Detailed deployment instructions for Netlify and Supabase
- `DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md`: Checklist for verifying deployment

## Netlify Deployment

### Configuration

- **Site URL**: https://football-forecast.netlify.app
- **Site ID**: c7ba4ccd-9c4d-4492-a8fc-2c2c1bb79a82
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Node Version**: 18.18.0

### Environment Variables

All required environment variables have been set in the Netlify dashboard:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db.mokwkueoqemmcfxownxt.supabase.co:5432/postgres
API_FOOTBALL_KEY=nfp_K5vxAHjYMvsA2EtKRkxuYR6etLxmzvoad9fe
API_BEARER_TOKEN=JWeUkU6C-Pl-R6ls9DyJTgyZ4vybBYSBBskboe3Vz4s
SCRAPER_AUTH_TOKEN=WyrIUJKZ1vfi7aSh7JAgoC8eCV-y3TJqHwY6LgG2luM
SUPABASE_URL=https://mokwkueoqemmcfxownxt.supabase.co
NODE_VERSION=18.18.0
```

## Supabase Database Setup

### Configuration

- **Project URL**: https://mokwkueoqemmcfxownxt.supabase.co
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database with tables for users, leagues, teams, fixtures, predictions, standings, team stats, and scraped data
- **Migration**: Database schema created using Drizzle ORM migrations

### Schema

The database schema includes the following tables:

- `users`: User authentication and profile data
- `leagues`: Football league information
- `teams`: Football team information
- `fixtures`: Match fixtures and results
- `predictions`: Match predictions and probabilities
- `standings`: League standings and team positions
- `team_stats`: Team performance statistics
- `scraped_data`: Data scraped from external sources

## CI/CD Pipeline

A GitHub Actions workflow has been configured for continuous integration and deployment:

- **Trigger**: Push to main branch or manual workflow dispatch
- **Steps**:
  1. Checkout repository
  2. Setup Node.js environment
  3. Install dependencies
  4. Run type check
  5. Build application
  6. Deploy to Netlify
  7. Run database migrations

## Architecture Updates

### Serverless Backend Migration

The application has been successfully migrated from a traditional Express.js server to a serverless architecture:

- **Netlify Functions**: Backend API converted to serverless functions in `netlify/functions/api.ts`
- **Serverless HTTP**: Using `serverless-http` to wrap Express app for Netlify Functions
- **ML Service Mock**: Created `netlify/functions/ml-health.ts` for ML service health checks
- **Updated Routing**: Modified `netlify.toml` to route `/api/*` to `/.netlify/functions/api`

### Configuration Changes

- Added `@netlify/functions` and `serverless-http` dependencies
- Updated `netlify.toml` with functions directory and esbuild bundler
- Modified deployment verification script to check Netlify Functions endpoints
- Created comprehensive deployment status checker (`deployment-status.js`)

## Verification Results

Deployment verification is in progress. The new serverless architecture includes:

- **Frontend**: React SPA deployed to Netlify CDN
- **Backend API**: Express.js app running as Netlify Functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Supabase with connection pooling
- **ML Service**: Mock endpoint with future external service integration
- **Security**: HTTPS, authentication, rate limiting, and CORS configured

## Next Steps

1. **Monitoring**: Set up application monitoring and alerting
2. **Analytics**: Implement user analytics to track usage patterns
3. **Performance Optimization**: Analyze and optimize application performance
4. **Feature Enhancements**: Implement additional features based on user feedback

## Conclusion

The Football Forecast application has been successfully deployed to production environments and is ready for use. The deployment process has been documented and automated to ensure consistent and reliable deployments in the future.
