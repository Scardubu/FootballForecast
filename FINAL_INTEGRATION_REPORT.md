# Final Integration Report - Football Forecast

## üîç Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. WebSocket Connection Failures

**Issue**: WebSocket connections were failing with error code 1006 (abnormal closure) and the message "WebSocket is closed before the connection is established."

**Root Cause**: 
- Browser preview proxy was causing connection issues with WebSockets
- Error handling was not properly managing reconnection attempts
- WebSocket initialization in the server had timing issues with dynamic imports

**Solutions Applied**:
- Enhanced WebSocket URL handling to detect and handle proxy scenarios
- Improved error handling in WebSocket client to provide better diagnostics
- Added forced close on error to trigger proper reconnection flow
- Implemented unlimited reconnection attempts in development mode
- Fixed server-side WebSocket initialization to properly await dynamic imports

### 2. API Query Timeouts

**Issue**: API queries to `/api/fixtures?league=39` were timing out, causing application failures.

**Root Cause**:
- Timeout was set too short (5 seconds) for slower network conditions
- Error handling wasn't properly switching to offline mode on timeout
- Missing proper team data in offline mode responses

**Solutions Applied**:
- Increased timeout duration from 5 to 10 seconds for better reliability
- Enhanced error handling to explicitly detect and handle AbortError (timeout)
- Improved offline mode switching with proper event dispatching
- Added team name resolution in mock data responses

### 3. useApi Hook Issues

**Issue**: The useApi hook had several issues causing TypeScript errors and runtime failures.

**Root Cause**:
- Missing variable declaration for `path`
- Syntax errors with extra closing braces
- Improper error handling for network failures
- Incomplete mock data structure for football fixtures

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added proper path variable declaration using lowercase URL
- Fixed syntax errors and removed extra closing braces
- Enhanced error handling with specific cases for different error types
- Improved mock data structure with proper team name resolution

### 4. Documentation Issues

**Issue**: Markdown lint errors in documentation files.

**Root Cause**:
- Missing blank lines around headings and lists
- Bare URLs not wrapped in angle brackets

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added proper spacing around headings and lists
- Wrapped all URLs in angle brackets for proper Markdown formatting
