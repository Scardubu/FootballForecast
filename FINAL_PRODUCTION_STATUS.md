## 🎯 Critical Issue Resolution

### ✅ Storage Initialization Race Condition - RESOLVED

**Problem:**
```
ERROR: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getLeagues')
ERROR: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createIngestionEvent')
```

**Root Cause:**
The `storage` object was being exported as `undefined` initially, then set asynchronously. When `runDataSeeder()` and `beginIngestionEvent()` tried to access it (even with `await storageReady`), they encountered the uninitialized value due to JavaScript's module loading semantics.

**Solution Applied:**
Modified `server/storage.ts` to initialize `storage` as a `MemStorage` instance immediately:

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
let storage: IStorage | undefined;

const storageReady = (async () => {
  if (usingDatabase) {
    storage = await DatabaseStorage.create();
  } else {
    storage = new MemStorage();
  }
})();

export const exportedStorage: IStorage = storage as IStorage; // ❌ undefined!
export { exportedStorage as storage };
```

```typescript
// After (WORKING):
let storage: IStorage = new MemStorage(); // ✅ Always defined

const storageReady = (async () => {
  if (usingDatabase) {
    try {
      storage = await DatabaseStorage.create(); // Upgrades to DB
      console.log('Using Database storage');
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('Using Memory storage (database initialization failed)');
    }
  } else {
    console.log('Using Memory storage (no DATABASE_URL or explicitly disabled)');
  }
  return storage;
})();

export { storageReady };
export { storage }; // ✅ Live binding to always-valid storage
```

**Key Changes:**
1. **Immediate initialization** - `storage` is always a valid `MemStorage` instance from the start
2. **Live binding** - The export provides a reference that updates when upgraded to `DatabaseStorage`
3. **Graceful upgrade** - Database storage is attempted asynchronously, falling back to memory if it fails
